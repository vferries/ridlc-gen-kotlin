# ridl-rt-kt-coroutines

## Responsibility

This module is the `suspend` adapter over the polling face (docs/design.md §5,
D-K6): one function,
`await(port: Wakeable, interest: Interest, poll: () -> T?):
T`, which suspends
until a polling read of a face answers, woken by the runtime's `Wakeable`
extension of [`ridl-rt-kt`](../ridl-rt-kt/README.md) under the key the read's
answer changes under. It is a JVM library over `kotlinx-coroutines-core`. The
repository is licensed under the root [MIT License](../../LICENSE).

```kotlin
val correlation = client.average(Window.of(10))
val reply = await(port, Interest.Outcome(correlation.correlation)) {
    client.averageReply(correlation)
}
```

Each round registers under `interest`, then calls `poll`, as the `Wakeable`
contract requires, until `poll` answers something other than `null`; an outcome
that lands between the read and the suspension still wakes it. One waker serves
the whole wait, so the port sees one task registering again rather than a new
one each round. `port` is the handle the read goes through: a provider waiting
on a handler of its own passes that handler, not the aggregate. A wait is
bounded with `withTimeout`, as nothing in a port times out.

## Status

Stage K5, keyed by driftsys/ridlc-gen-kotlin#5. `AwaitTest` pins the properties
above over a hand-driven `Wakeable` with one waker per key: a known value after
one registration and one read, registration before every read, no wake from
another key, one waker for the whole wait, and a wake from another thread. The
cabin sample's `CoroutineDemo.kt` runs a consumer and a provider on two threads
over the loopback with it.

## O-K3: no `*Await` extension, generated or hand-written

docs/design.md §5 has two generated one-line extensions per call,
`suspend fun <Iface>Client<P>.averageAwait(window)`, and O-K3 leaves open
whether they are generated or written by hand in the sample, to be decided by
writing the sample both ways and keeping the shorter. Measured on the cabin
sample's two calls:

| Form                                                                     | Lines at the call sites | Lines written beside them                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `await(port, Interest.Outcome(c.correlation)) { client.<call>Reply(c) }` |                       4 | none                                                                                                                     |
| hand-written `<call>Await` extensions                                    |                       2 | about 4 per call, each taking the port the client keeps private                                                          |
| generated `<call>Await` extensions                                       |                       2 | none, but every generated package then depends on `kotlinx-coroutines`, or a third plugin option decides whether it does |

The recommendation, for disposition, is the first: the generic `await` is the
whole adapter, the generated face stays free of any coroutine dependency, and a
call's suspending form is its send and one `await`.
