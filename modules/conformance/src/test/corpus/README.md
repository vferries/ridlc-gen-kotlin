# The corpus

One directory per package the conformance tests build with the pinned `ridl`.
Each is copied unchanged from `driftsys/ridl` at the tag in
`../../../ridl-release`, except `kt-values`, which is this repository's own, and
the `ridl.toml` of two single-file fixtures, which the ridl tests compile
without a manifest.

| Directory    | Source at the pinned tag                                             | What it exercises                                                                                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cabin`      | `examples/cabin`                                                     | integer ranges, an enum, a struct, the four interaction kinds                                             |
| `veh-common` | `crates/ridlc/tests/corpus/veh-common`                               | unit floats with a step, constants, an enum set over an enum, a result union, collections, `ridl.std`     |
| `fb-demo`    | `crates/ridl-backend-rust/tests/fixtures/flatbuffers_roundtrip.ridl` | bytes, a vacuous boolean, an enum set with its own bits, every collection shape, optional composites      |
| `veh-cruise` | `crates/ridl-backend-proto/tests/fixtures/cruise.ridl`               | a retired enum value, a retired union arm, a map keyed by an inline string                                |
| `kt-values`  | this repository                                                      | a same-package pattern, a regex constant, a float step from a negative minimum, inline scalar constraints |

`veh-common` references `ridl.std`, which `ridl build` writes as a package of
its own, so the plugin is also run on the standard library's patterned strings
and fixed-length bytes.
