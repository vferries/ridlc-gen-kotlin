## Responsibility

This module owns the pinned `ridl` release, the corpus, and every test of
docs/design.md §7 that needs the plugin from outside. It is a JVM test module.
The repository is licensed under the root [MIT License](../../LICENSE).

- `ridl-release` is the pin: one `driftsys/ridl` release tag. The `installRidl`
  task installs that release's `ridl` binary into `build/ridl` with the
  release's own `install.sh`; `RIDL_BIN=<path>` uses an installed `ridl`
  instead, for a machine with no network. The pin never resolves to a local
  checkout.
- `src/test/corpus/` holds one directory per corpus package; its README says
  where each comes from and what it exercises.
- `src/test/resources/probes/` holds hand-written probes, compiled with a
  package's generated code, for what the model-driven probe does not reach.
- `checkSchema`, run by `check`, fails when the schema vendored under
  `modules/ridlc-gen-kotlin/src/main/proto` differs from the pinned release's.

## Status

Pinned to `editor-v0.2.2`. The tests of stage K2a run: a request the pinned
`ridl` wrote parses, a request with an unknown key parses, a request nested
1,000 levels parses in process and through the installed script, a wrong schema
is one error diagnostic and exit 0, an unknown option is an error diagnostic,
unreadable input is exit 3, and the parity test compares `ridl build` with
`--plugin kotlin=<script>` to the script invoked directly, for every package
each build hands the plugin.

The tests of stage K2b: for every corpus package, the generated `Types.kt`
compiles with `kotlin-compile-testing` against `ridl-rt-kt` with warnings as
errors; and a probe written from the model, compiled with it, checks that every
constrained scalar accepts each bound and refuses one step outside it with the
right rule, that enums and enum sets read their declared members and no other,
and, for `kt-values`, that a struct checks its collections and inline fields.
Removing the float maximum check, counting UTF-16 units, or dropping an array
bound from the emitter each turns the probe red.

The test of stage K1b, `SpikeTest`: the cabin package's payload codecs, written
by hand over `ridl.rt.flatbuffers`, encode the bytes the Rust codec of the
pinned release encodes (`resources/flatbuffers/cabin-golden.txt`), and a corpus
of 1,385 mutants of those bytes is refused or decoded exactly as the Rust
verifier refuses or decodes it (`cabin-rust-verdicts.txt`), never by an
exception of the JVM's own. How to regenerate both files is in
[`docs/k1b-flatbuffers-spike.md`](../../docs/k1b-flatbuffers-spike.md).

The test of stage K2c, `CodecTest`: for every corpus package, the generated
`Codec.kt` encodes sample values of every public root, written from the model
(`RoundTrip`), and a corpus of those buffers and their mutants — 10,266 in all —
goes through `verify`, `decode` and `encode` again in Kotlin and, once, in the
Rust codec of the pinned release, whose verdicts are checked in as
`resources/flatbuffers/<package>-codec-rust-verdicts.txt`. Every sample
re-encodes to the same bytes in Rust, no buffer meets an exception other than
`VerifyError`, and every verdict is Rust's except where Kotlin alone refuses a
step, a NaN or an inline constraint. A wrong table layout, a missing count check
or a wrong union error each turns it red.

The test of stage K3a, `FacesTest`: the generated faces of `cabin` and
`kt-values`, over `ridl-rt-kt-loopback`, driven by the probes of
`resources/faces/`. Cabin's four interaction kinds round-trip — a signal set and
read, an event raised and received, a command sent, dispatched and acknowledged,
a query sent, dispatched and replied — and `dispatch`'s settlement table is
reached past the client: a failing `require`, a corrupt argument buffer, an
argument outside its constraints, an unknown ordinal, another interface's
number, a settlement the handler refuses, a buffer too short. `kt-values`'
`Probe` adds a failing `ensure`, a float clause and a signal's own init. A wrong
comparison operator, a wrong settlement or a missing interface check each turns
it red.
