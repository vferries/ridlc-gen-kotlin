// The six role handles and their port implementations: the spelling of
// `crates/ridl-loopback/src/handle.rs`.
//
// A runtime presents one handle type per port role (ADR-0021 decision 12).
// The six here group the eleven roles as that decision derives the threading
// split: the five roles with a mutating method take a handle each, and the six
// whose methods only read share one.
//
// | Handle          | Port roles beside `Attached` and `Wakeable`                                    | Kinds of key it stores         | Threading            |
// | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
// | `ReaderHandle`  | `Clock`, `SignalReader`, `FixedReader`, `ScannableSignals`, `CoherentSignals` | none                           | any threads at once  |
// | `WriterHandle`  | `SignalWriter`                                                                 | none                           | one thread at a time |
// | `SourceHandle`  | `EventSource`                                                                  | `Event`, one waker             | one thread at a time |
// | `SinkHandle`    | `EventSink`                                                                    | none                           | one thread at a time |
// | `CallerHandle`  | `Clock`, `Caller`                                                              | `Outcome`, kept with each call | one thread at a time |
// | `HandlerHandle` | `Handler`                                                                      | `Claim`, one waker             | one thread at a time |
//
// `Wakeable` is on every handle, because each handle wakes its own waiters. A
// handle stores a waker only under a kind of key one of its roles observes:
// one waker per kind for `Event` and `Claim`, which a change to any key of
// that kind wakes (ADR-0021 decision 13), and an `Outcome` waker with its
// call. A registration under any other kind is woken at once, because nothing
// that handle could read changes under it. `Slot` is woken at once too, and
// never stored, because the call table has no bound and a slot is always free.
// `CallerHandle` carries `Clock`, because a client that waits for an outcome
// within a bound reads the clock of the port it calls (ADR-0023 decision 6).
//
// Every store access is under the store's monitor, so the reader handle holds
// no state of its own and is safe from any thread; the other five hold state
// of their own — staged changes, sequence counters, a served set — that is not
// synchronized, and each is driven by one thread at a time, as the Rust
// handles are `Send` and not `Sync`.
//
// Input buffers are read from their position to their limit and left as they
// were, as a Rust slice is borrowed; output buffers are written from their
// position, which is advanced past the bytes written.
