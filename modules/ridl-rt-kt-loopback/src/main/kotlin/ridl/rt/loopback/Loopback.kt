/**
 * The in-process reference runtime: every port of `ridl-rt-kt` over one
 * in-memory store, and the aggregate handle that implements all twelve port
 * interfaces by delegating to the six role handles it holds. It is what a
 * generated `Client`, `Publisher` or `dispatch` is built over in a test.
 *
 * It is not a transport — nothing leaves the process — and not a checker:
 * payload bytes are opaque to it. It holds no catalog descriptor, so it
 * never reports `NotOwner`, never a `Contract` error except from an
 * unprovisioned [readFixed], and every value's freshness is `Unbounded`.
 * Nothing detaches, so `Detached` never appears. The one bound is the call
 * table's [SLOTS]: a send with every slot taken throws `SendError.Busy`.
 * Nothing else is bounded, so `TooLarge` appears only from [failNextSettle],
 * and a `Transport.Busy` reaches a caller only when a provider settles a call
 * with it.
 *
 * The catalog is carried and never compared: checking it against an
 * interface's own is a generated face's job (ADR-0021 decision 3).
 *
 * It also presents [Wakeable], and routes each key to the role handle that
 * observes it: `Outcome` and `Slot` to the caller, `Event` to the source,
 * `Claim` to the handler.
