// lives on that handle. Every operation below runs under the store's monitor,
// reads or writes the maps and returns: no port method waits for data while
// holding it, which is what `ridl.rt.port` requires of every port method.
//
// No waker runs under the monitor either. Every operation here that would wake
// a task returns the wakers instead, and the handle wakes them after leaving
// the monitor, so a waker that reaches back into this runtime from another
// thread cannot find the monitor held by the thread that woke it. A waker is
// stored here although one handle registered it, because another handle's
// operation wakes it.
