# ridl-rt-kt-loopback

## Responsibility

This module is the in-process reference runtime every test runs over: every port
of [`ridl-rt-kt`](../ridl-rt-kt/README.md) over one in-memory store, a map and a
queue, no IO; the Kotlin spelling of `crates/ridl-loopback` (docs/design.md §3,
§6). It is a JVM library in the package `ridl.rt.loopback`, depending on
`ridl-rt-kt` alone. The repository is licensed under the root
[MIT License](../../LICENSE).

`Loopback` is the aggregate handle a generated face is built over: it implements
all twelve port interfaces by delegating to six role handles, `ReaderHandle`,
`WriterHandle`, `SourceHandle`, `SinkHandle`, `CallerHandle` and
`HandlerHandle`, which `split()` hands out and `reader()`, `writer()` and the
other factories add; `attach()` adds a second aggregate on the same store.
`advance` drives the clock by hand, `provisionFixed` supplies a `fixed`, and
`failNextSettle` injects the one fault the runtime has.

## Status

Stage K1c. The port contract tests any runtime can run are the suite of
[`ridl-rt-kt-conformance`](../ridl-rt-kt-conformance/README.md), which
`ConformanceTest` runs over this runtime, all 41 (driftsys/ridlc-gen-kotlin#8).
`PortsTest` is what stays in `crates/ridl-loopback/tests/ports.rs` on ridl
`main`, the tests only this runtime can express, each for the reason that file
gives, plus the JVM-specific tests below.

driftsys/ridlc-gen-kotlin#5 adds the `Wakeable` of ridl `main` (story E11.16, as
c2543c2 left it). Every handle is `Wakeable`, and stores one waker per kind of
key it observes: `SourceHandle` one `Event` waker, `HandlerHandle` one `Claim`
waker, `CallerHandle` an `Outcome` waker with each call and one `Slot` waker;
any other kind is woken at once. The aggregate routes each key to the handle
that observes it, and `CallerHandle` also carries `Clock`. Closing a handler
returns the claims it held and had not settled to the waiting calls, in send
order, and wakes the handlers that serve them (ADR-0021 decision 5).

`attach()`, of ridl 0.5.0 (driftsys/ridl#488), makes a second aggregate on the
same store: six new role handles, opened as `reader()` to `handler()` open one
each, so an application holds several faces over one runtime, each owning its
own. What is in the store is shared — the published signals, the `fixed` values,
the clock and the call table — and what is on a handle is not carried over: the
attached aggregate starts subscribed to nothing, with nothing staged, no call
sent and nothing served. The Kotlin aggregate has no `close`; closing the
handles an attached aggregate splits into is what dropping it does in Rust, and
closes only those. `PortsTest` holds the eight cases of
`crates/ridl-loopback/tests/ports.rs`.

driftsys/ridlc-gen-kotlin#10 adds `ReadError.ShortClaim` of ridl 0.4.0
(driftsys/ridl#569, ADR-0021 decision 5 amended 2026-09-28). A call whose
arguments do not fit `nextClaim`'s buffer is offered rather than taken: its
claim id is minted on the call's entry and kept for every later presentation,
the claim is recorded as the handler's, and the call stays among the waiting
calls. Another handler that serves the member may take it, and the claim moves
to that handler. `settle` accepts the id unread and takes the call out of the
waiting calls. A forgotten offered call stays presentable until its settlement,
or the close of its handler, which withdraws it; the close of a handler that was
only offered a call neither returns it nor wakes anyone.

ridl 0.6.0 (driftsys/ridl#752): the loopback carries the trace context, under
rules 1 and 2 of the delivery contract. A call's entry keeps the context it was
sent with, and its `Claim` and every `ReadError.ShortClaim` that offers it carry
that context; `raise` copies its context into every subscribed source's queue,
and the `RawOccurrence` carries it. `ConformanceTest` runs the suite's trace arm
too.

The call table is `ridl-rt-kt`'s `correlate.Table`, with `Loopback.SLOTS`
(sixteen) slots and no byte budget, as story E11.18 moved the Rust loopback onto
it (ridl `main` at eb41a7a). A send with every slot taken throws
`SendError.Busy` on every caller and draws no sequence number. `forget`, or the
close of the caller that sent the call, is what frees a slot, and a freed slot
wakes every caller's `Slot` waker; a `Slot` registration while a slot is free is
woken at once. A forgotten call that no handler has claimed is withdrawn at once
(ridl `main` at 5ac7082): it is never presented, and its slot comes back, so
calls to a member no handler serves do not fill the table for good. A claimed
one keeps its slot until its settlement, and a handler closed while it holds a
forgotten call withdraws that call rather than returning it. The withdrawal is
this runtime's behaviour, not a port contract. A returned claim goes back in
send order, which a reused slot's correlation does not give. `WakeableTest` is
the "Waking" and "The bounded call table" tests of `ports.rs` at 44e59fa, the
ones only this runtime can express, under the same names and in the same order;
the 15 that story E11.20 moved into the suite run from `ConformanceTest`.

## Where the code departs from the Rust loopback

- **Threading.** The Rust handles are `Send`, and the reader is also `Sync`,
  proved at compile time. Here every store access is under one monitor, so the
  reader handle is safe from any thread; the other five hold unsynchronized
  state of their own and are driven by one thread at a time, which is a rule of
  use, not something the compiler checks.
- **`SourceHandle`, `CallerHandle` and `HandlerHandle` are `AutoCloseable`.**
  The Rust handles remove their state from the store on drop — a source its
  queue and waiter, a caller its `Slot` waiter and the calls it did not forget,
  a handler its waiter and the claims it held — and the JVM has no drop, so
  `close()` does it. A source never closed keeps receiving copies while the
  runtime lives, and a caller never closed keeps the slots of the calls it did
  not forget. With no destructor, no JVM handle is closed by dropping a waker,
  so the three `..._drops_without_deadlock` tests of `ports.rs` have no Kotlin
  spelling.
- **`split()` cannot consume the aggregate**, so the aggregate's port methods
  throw `IllegalStateException` after it; the factories and the test controls
  still work.
- **Buffers.** An input buffer is read from its position to its limit and left
  where it was, as a borrowed slice is; the bytes are copied, so the caller may
  reuse the buffer. An output buffer is written from its position, which is
  advanced; on `ReadError.Short` or `ReadError.ShortClaim` nothing is written.
  `ridl-rt-kt`'s port contract now states both.
- **`Handler.settle`** takes a Kotlin `Result`; a failure that is not a
  `CallError` is refused with `IllegalArgumentException`.
- **Wakers run outside the monitor.** As in Rust, a store operation returns the
  wakers to wake and the handle wakes them after leaving the monitor. The JVM
  monitor is reentrant, so what this protects against is a waker that reads the
  runtime from another thread, not one that re-enters on its own.
