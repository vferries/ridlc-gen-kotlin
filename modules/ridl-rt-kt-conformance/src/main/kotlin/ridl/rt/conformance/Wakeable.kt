// `Wakeable`: which change wakes which stored waker, and when.
// `crates/ridl-rt-conformance/src/wakeable.rs` (story E11.20, second half, at
// ridl `main` 44e59fa). A runtime may omit the extension, so these tests run
// only through [wakeableSuite].
//
// The contract is the interface's own documentation and ADR-0021 decision 13:
// a handle stores one waker per kind of key — `Slot`, `Event`, `Claim` — and
// an `Outcome` waker with its call; a change to any key of that kind wakes the
// stored waker, which is cleared when woken; a registration by the same task
// is a refresh and wakes nothing; a registration by another task displaces
// the stored waker and wakes it. Every `Slot` waker is woken when a slot is
// reclaimed (decision 15).
//
// A spurious wake is allowed, so no test asserts that a change leaves a waker
// unwoken, except the one change the contract rules out, a refresh. A test
// asserts that a waker is not yet woken only right after its registration,
// with no change made since, or after it was woken once and cleared. Whether a
// registration whose key already holds is woken at once is the runtime's too.
