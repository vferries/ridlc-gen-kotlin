// `ridl-rt-kt-conformance`, the port contract tests generic over a runtime:
// the spelling of `crates/ridl-rt-conformance/src/lib.rs` (story E11.20, at
// ridl `main` 44e59fa).
//
// Each public test method of the contract classes here is one test of what
// `ridl.rt.port` states a runtime does behind a port. They are generic over a
// [Factory], the one thing a runtime writes to run them. A runtime runs the
// whole suite from its own tests with [suite], and the tests of the
// extensions it implements with [scannableSuite], [coherentSuite] and
// [wakeableSuite], and, when it carries the trace context, [traceSuite]:
//
//     @TestFactory fun ports() = suite(MyFactory)
//     @TestFactory fun scannable() = scannableSuite(MyFactory)
//     @TestFactory fun trace() = traceSuite(MyFactory)
//
// What the suite leaves out is the crate documentation's list, unchanged: what
// the port contract leaves to a runtime (where the clock starts, what `advance`
// does with a negative duration, which error the injected fault reports beyond
// not being `UnknownClaim`); a handler that has served nothing; two event sinks
// on one event channel; `FixedReader`; anything a runtime reports from a
// catalog descriptor; the threading model; a runtime's own API beyond the
// factory; a wake the contract allows but does not require; which serving
// handlers a call wakes; what a forget does to a call no handler has claimed,
// beyond giving its slot back once withdrawn or settled; and the close of a
// handle.
