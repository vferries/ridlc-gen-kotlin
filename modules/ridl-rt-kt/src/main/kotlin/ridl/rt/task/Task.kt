// A Rust future is polled with a waker and answers `Pending` or `Ready`; its
// Kotlin spelling is a function that takes the waker and answers `null` or the
// value, which is what a polling read of a face already is.

 *
 * [poll] is called once at once, then once more after every wake of the
 * waker it was given, which unparks this thread. Between polls the thread is
 * parked, so the wait costs no CPU. An unpark that arrives while the thread
 * is not parked is kept as a permit that ends the next park at once, so a
 * wake between a poll and the park after it is not lost. An unpark that is
 * not from the waker, or a park that ends on its own, costs one extra poll.
 *
 * - [deadline] `null`: waits until [poll] answers, however long that takes.
 * - Otherwise: returns the value of the first poll that answers one, whenever
 *   that poll runs, even after a park that ended late; returns `null` once a
 *   poll answers `null` at or after [deadline]. [poll] runs at least once,
 *   even when [deadline] has passed on entry. Each park is given at most the
 *   time left.
