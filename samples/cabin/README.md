# cabin

## Responsibility

This sample is the JVM demonstration (docs/design.md §6): the ridl repository's
`examples/cabin` package, generated into Kotlin by the pinned `ridl` running
this repository's plugin, with a Kotlin consumer and a Kotlin provider
round-tripping over
[`ridl-rt-kt-loopback`](../../modules/ridl-rt-kt-loopback/README.md). It is the
Kotlin twin of that repository's `examples/cabin/consumer`. The repository is
licensed under the root [MIT License](../../LICENSE).

- `ridl/` is the package: `cabin.ridl` and `ridl.toml`, copied from
  `examples/cabin` at the pinned release.
- The `generateCabin` task runs
  `ridl build --plugin kotlin=<the installed
  plugin>` over it into
  `build/generated/ridl`, which is the generated half of the main source set;
  nothing generated is tracked.
- `src/main/kotlin/ridl/sample/cabin/Main.kt` is the application: one loopback
  per round trip, a signal, an event, a command and a query, each printing the
  value it carried.

```sh
just demo
```

## Status

Stages K4 and K5. `just demo` prints `signal ok 21`, `event ok 5`,
`command ok 42` and `query ok 7`, then `coroutine query ok 7`,
`coroutine command ok 42` and `coroutine event ok 5`, and `DemoTest` pins those
seven lines.
